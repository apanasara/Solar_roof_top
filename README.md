# 4.7kW Solar Roof Top in Gujarat, India(2019-2020)
Solar PV Array Installation project

## Process of Execution 
1. Site Survey to understand 
    * Maximum capacity based on area available
    * Shadow constrains
    * Structure feasibility (Location of Columns, Joints to be done with Floor/Perapet)
2. Understanding Govt Norms for Subsidy & Technical Specification required
3. Costing & Breakeven - Analysis for Cost recovery
4. Selection of Panels, Inverters etc
5. Designing structure based on
    * Panel Size, fastneing method & its orientation
    * Loading Conditions : Dead Loads (Panel Load & self Weight), Wid Loads, Dynamic Loads (Live Load-Human / animal like monkes)
    * Ease in Maintainace & Cleaning Approach
    * Galvanization process requirements (no closed volume, hanging hoocks, Zinc water drain-off)
    * Shadow Analysis of panel-configuration to finalize the structure
6. Wire Routing
7. Lighning Arrestor Location & Clamping

## Structure
### Why to chose Hollow section structure?

Hollow section have better Strength to Weight ratio. Hence, economical in set up
Additionally less area exposure to environment (less chance for protective layer demage) hence less maintenance against corrosion prevention


### Galvanization

I visited factory of Hot Dip Galvanization, Where there were Bath tub for Acid for surface cleaning and Hot Zinc bath for Protective Zinc Coating.
They instructed me following points to be considered while designing / fabrication
1. Hollow Section should be open to Air from any end so that Air Blast while dipping into Hot Bath.
2. Holes in Hollow Section should be in such a way that Zinc Water can be easily drained out from the hollow parts, otherwise expensive Zn can be avoided to be chocked unnecessary.
3. Iron should not be prepainted for Zn Coating.
4. Hanging provision should be in such a way that material can be lifted by crane hook & can be put for dry out.
5. Thin portions can be deshaped while handling for Zinc Coating process due to Lot-Weight.

Welding done post galvanization can damage Zinc Coating, Hence, Welding should be done before galvanization.

### Shadow Analysis
 2 Reports of Shadow Analysis should be observed on 3D Model based on following criteria to test whether shadow of surrounding objects is impacting on panel or not (for Longitude Latitude of site)
  1. Date of Winter solstice (hiemal solstice or hibernal solstice) occurs when either of Earth's poles reaches its maximum tilt _away from the Sun_. 
  2. Date of Summer solstice (estival solstice or midsummer) occurs when one of Earth's poles has its maximum tilt _toward the Sun_. 

## Electric

1. There will be 3 groundings (for Lighting arrestor, Inverter & Panel-Structure).
2. Inverter should be nearer as much as possible to avoide DC Losses & safety.
3. Joints in wiring should be avoided for Heat Losses.
4. Lighting Arrestor should be placed 1m away & above plane of Panels
5. Grounding pit should be atleast 1m away from each other.
6. Lighting Grounding Line should be in seprate conduite (High Current/Voltage)
7. Lightning Arrestor hould be firmly holdedwith structure otherwise It may struck on panel & cause for panel damage.
8. Lightning Arrestor should not directly above panel to avoid bird-littering on pannel

## point to be agreed with solar installer agency for material delivery

1. login must be provided to view status of subsidy
2. before HDG, welding can be done, after HDG welding is prohibited
3. after subsidy approval payment will be done (other then 10% down-payment)
4. inverter make & panel make to be confirmed before purchase (payment of those items should be done only if make is freezed)
