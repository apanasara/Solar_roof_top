## Why to chose Hollow section structure?

Hollow section have better Strength to Weight ratio. Hence, economical in set up
Additionally less area exposure to environment (less chance for protective layer demage) hence less maintenance against corrosion prevention

## Losses understanding

## Galvanization

I visited factory of Hot Dip Galvanization, Where there were Bath tub for Acid for surface cleaning and Hot Zinc bath for Protective Zinc Coating.
They instructed me following points to be considered while designing / fabrication
1. Hollow Section should be open to Air from any end so that Air Blast while dipping into Hot Bath.
2. Holes in Hollow Section should be in such a way that Zinc Water can be easily drained out from the hollow parts, otherwise expensive Zn can be avoided to be chocked unnecessary.
3. Iron should not be prepainted for Zn Coating.
4. Hanging provision should be in such a way that material can be lifted by crane hook & can be put for dry out.
5. Thin portions can be deshaped while handling for Zinc Coating process due to Lot-Weight.

Welding done post galvanization can damage Zinc Coating, Hence, Welding should be done before galvanization.

## Electric Wiring

1. Lighting Arrestor should be placed 1m away & above plane of Panels
2. There will be 3 groundings (for Lighting arrestor, Inverter & Panel-Structure). Grounding pit should be atleast 1m away from each other.
3. Inverter should be nearer as much as possible to avoide DC Losses & safety.
4. Lighting Grounding Line should be in seprate conduite (High Current/Voltage)
5. Joints in wiring should be avoided for Heat Losses

## point to be agreed with solar installer agency for material delivery

1. login must be provided to view status of subsidy
2. before HDG, welding can be done, after HDG welding is prohibited
3. after subsidy approval payment will be done (other then 10% down-payment)
4. inverter make & panel make to be confirmed before purchase (payment of those items should be done only if make is freezed)
